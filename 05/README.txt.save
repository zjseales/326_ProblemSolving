Maori Translation Program
COSC 326 Etude 05

AUTHORS:
	Zac Seales
	Amaan Aamir

INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Compile all java files.
>>javac -Xlint *.java

  2. Run the program by entering English sentences through stdin.
--
NOTE: Input sentences must begin with a pronoun and end with a verb.
--
	a) Either, run the program and type input into the command terminal
>>java Translator

	b) or, redirect a file of input to stdin
>>java Translator < validSentences.txt

PROGRAM INFO:
The Translator class reads lines of input, calls the translate method from
the Translate class, and outputs the results (if no error occurred).

There are 3 components which determine the final Maori translation;
Pronoun, tense, and verb. This program attempts to determine these values
which are represented in the 'components' array.
The main method will ignore any components array which is not complete.

The translate method checks the first word of the input to ensure it is
a valid pronoun.
It then attempts to determine the tense from any words that are not the 
pronoun or the verb.
The verb is then analyzed and translated.
If the tense has not yet been determined then the valid verb will determine 
the tense.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
None this code is full-proof.
It's very likely there's connecting words that we haven't considered though.


WHO DID WHAT:
Zac Seales wrote the README file, the comments and the initial code,
also worked largely on error and bug-checking.
Amaan Aamir wrote test data and ensured test data lined up with correct results.
Amaan also worked on the rules and bug-checking.
