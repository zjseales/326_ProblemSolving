INSTRUCTIONS

1. Compile the java files from the outside of the folder.
>>javac -Xlint VidMan/*.java

2. Run the VidMenu from outside the folder.
>>java VidMan/VidMenu

(I'm not sure why you can't do it from inside the folder)
-------------------------------------
PROGRAM INFORMATION

A main menu frame is displayed which allows the user to either add a string,
or view current strings in the list, or exit.
The viewer also gives the option to remove a selected string.

I'm not sure how to store videos, currently my program just takes in strings.
They're supposed to represent the file-paths of videos, but the program
doesn't contain any checking.
