# 326_ProblemSolving
Programs to solve a range of complex problems.

Each folder has its own README file explaining:
- Program Information,
- Program execution instructions,
- Issues we had to overcome.

This paper was a group project, though I did literally everything apart from problem 04.
All README files that say otherwise were written by me. I've shared credit to avoid conflict.
