Zac Seales - 6687905 - seaza886

Instructions:
NOTE: '>>' is used to represent the command line window. 
      DO NOT type '>>'. Only type the text that follows.

 1. Compile all classes using,		
>>javac -Xlint *.java

 2. Either,
    a) run with a file (there in an attached files used for testing "dates.txt" 
>>java Dates dates.txt
    b) OR, run on it's own and type in a date
>>java Dates
    c) OR, redirect a text file to the stdin
>>java Dates < dates.txt

Program info:
The Dates class is only used to import a file, and check for validity,
using the dateCheck class
All error and validity checks are done in the DateCheck class.


INPUT files:
dates.txt

RESULTS:
I've redirected the output of the program into results.txt. 
You've asked for my results and I wanted to keep this file tidy.
But you should just be able to run the program yourself and get the same results.
